# Python---Logic--Building-Task--1
Logic Building Task - 1 is a beginner-friendly Python practice project that focuses on improving basic programming and problem-solving skills.
This project is a beginner-friendly Python logic building practice set created to strengthen fundamental programming concepts such as conditions, loops, variables, and basic problem solving.

It contains 5 small tasks implemented using pure Python (no external libraries required).

The tasks included in this project are:

User Login Check

Even or Odd Number Check

Find Largest of Three Numbers

Student Grade System

Error Message Detector

These tasks and sample outputs are based on the provided notebook content.

📌 Project Objectives

Improve logical thinking using Python

Practice if-else conditions and loops

Understand basic real-world style problems

Build confidence in writing simple Python programs

Prepare for interviews and coding tests (basic level)

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3.x

No external libraries required (only core Python)

📂 Tasks Overview
1️⃣ User Login Check

Checks whether the entered username and password match the stored credentials and prints:

Login Successful or

Invalid Credentials

2️⃣ Even or Odd Checker

Checks if a given number is:

Even

Odd

3️⃣ Largest of Three Numbers

Compares three numbers and prints the largest among them.

4️⃣ Student Grade System

Assigns a grade based on marks:

A (≥ 90)

B (≥ 75)

C (≥ 60)

D (≥ 50)

Fail (< 50)

5️⃣ Error Message Detector

Counts how many times "ERROR" appears in a list of log messages and prints the total count.

▶️ How to Run

Install Python 3.x on your system

Open the file in:

Jupyter Notebook or

Any Python editor (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)

Run the script or execute cells one by one

Modify input values (username, numbers, marks, logs) to test different cases

📈 Learning Outcomes

Better understanding of:

if-elif-else conditions

for loops

Variables and comparisons

Basic problem-solving in Python

Strong foundation for:

Data analysis

Automation scripts

Interview coding rounds

✅ Future Improvements (Optional)

Take user input using input()

Convert into a menu-driven program

Add file-based log analysis

Add exception handling

Build this as a small CLI tool
